# Privi

[简体中文](./README.md) · [English](./README.zh-CN.md) · [繁體中文（香港）](./README.zh-HK.md)

Personal, on-device **Android media vault**. Hide photos & videos from the system
gallery, rate them **1–3 hearts**, favorite, and play playlists with a
**built-in ExoPlayer** (native Android Media3, supports seamless continuous
playback). Lock the app with **pattern / PIN + biometric**. Dark theme only.
Sideload-only — media stays local; no cloud storage, accounts, or analytics.

**Author:** [kcng0](https://github.com/kcng0) · **License:** [MIT](./LICENSE) · **Support:** [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/kcng0)

This is a personal project; simplicity is favored over features.

## Install (APK)

Privi is not on Google Play. Download a release APK and sideload it:

1. Open the latest **[Release](https://github.com/kcng0/privi/releases/latest)**.
2. Download `privi-<version>.apk` (and optionally `SHA256SUMS`).
3. Verify the download (desktop):
   ```bash
   sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
   ```
4. On your phone, allow install from your browser/file manager if prompted.
5. Open the APK and install.

Each release includes:

| Asset | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `privi-<version>.apk` | Sideload install |
| `SHA256SUMS` / `.sha256` / `CHECKSUMS.txt` | Integrity check |
| **Source code (zip / tar.gz)** | Auto-attached by GitHub for the tag |

**Requirements:** Android 8.0+ (API 26). All media stays on-device.

> Official GitHub Release APKs are **release-signed** with a permanent keystore
> (same signature across versions). First-time installs of a new signature may
> still get a Play Protect "unknown app" prompt — use **Install anyway** and
> leave harmful-app detection enabled.

### Hot updates

Starting with **v1.0.4**, updates are fully user-controlled. Open **Settings →
Check updates** to check the latest stable GitHub Release first, then the
Shorebird hot-update channel for the installed base. A newer full release is
shown with a confirmation action that opens its GitHub Release page. When a
signed Dart patch is available, Privi asks before downloading it. Starting with
v1.0.5, a successful patch download restarts Privi automatically so the patch
is active immediately. The About dialog shows the base version/build and
applied patch number.

Android/native code, plugins, permissions, bundled assets, and Flutter engine
changes still require a new APK. Network access occurs only after the manual
check; vault media stays on-device.

## Features

- **Visible | Invisible** home — browse system gallery albums or the private vault
- **Independent mosaic/list views** — each home tab remembers its own layout
- **Directory hide** — media removed from the system gallery while kept on disk
- **Consistent HD posters** — the same 768px video frame before and after Hide
- **Stable date order** — folders keep original capture chronology after Hide
- **Hearts (0–3)** + favorites, album sorting, and manual drag-to-arrange
- **Collections** — create, rename, organize members, and dissolve without deleting media
- **Built-in ExoPlayer** — Android Media3 native video player with **seamless continuous playback** (auto-advances to next video), far better format support than system MediaPlayer
- **External player support** — hand-off to installed third-party players (e.g. VLC) with playback result tracking
- **Pattern / PIN + biometric** lock, optional `FLAG_SECURE` (block screenshots/screen recording)
- **Root resume lock** — covers every tab/route; only tracked media-app Back bypasses it
- **Share-to-Privi** import intents for images and videos
- Fully offline; all data stays on-device

## Screenshots

Captured from the current **Privi v1.0.25** Flutter UI using synthetic folders,
albums, collections, and the bundled app icon. No personal media or connected
device is used; the dark theme and latest Visible/Invisible/collection flows are
shown as they ship.

Maintainers can regenerate them without an Android device:
`flutter test tool/readme_screenshots_test.dart --update-goldens`.

- **Visible mosaic/list** — the tab-isolated home presentation toggle.
- **Invisible mosaic/list** — vault albums, ratings, counts, and collections.
- **Collection screens** — member mosaic/list views and CRUD management actions.
- **Settings / lock** — security, display, playback, and first-run pattern setup.

## Develop

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Notes |
|------|--------|
| Flutter **3.44.6** | Prefer [FVM](https://fvm.app/) (`.fvmrc` pins the exact version) |
| JDK 17+ | Android Gradle |
| Android SDK | platform **37**, build-tools, cmdline-tools, licenses accepted |
| Device / emulator | Android 8.0+ (API 26) |

> **Note:** iOS support has been removed. This project builds Android-only.

### One-shot setup (Ubuntu / WSL2)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kcng0/privi.git
cd privi

# Optional: install Flutter + Android SDK + licenses
./scripts/install-toolchain.sh && source ~/.bashrc

# Generate native scaffold (if needed), deps, codegen
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Run on a connected device
make run
```

### Everyday commands

```bash
make run       # launch on a connected device
make test      # unit + widget tests
make analyze   # static analysis
make format    # dart format lib test
make gen       # build_runner (Drift + Riverpod)
make watch     # codegen in watch mode
make apk       # release APK for sideloading
make help      # list targets
```

Without `make`, use `fvm flutter …` (or plain `flutter` if FVM is not installed).

## Releases & CI

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| [CI](./.github/workflows/ci.yaml) | push / PR to `main` | format, codegen, analyze, test only |
| [Release](./.github/workflows/release.yml) | tag `v*` or manual dispatch | Shorebird base APK + checksums + GitHub Release |
| [Patch](./.github/workflows/patch.yml) | manual dispatch on `main` | signed Dart patch for an existing base release |

To cut a release from a clean `main`:

```bash
# bump version in pubspec.yaml (e.g. 0.1.0+1 → 0.1.1+2), commit, then:
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin v0.1.1
```

Or run **Actions → Release APK → Run workflow**. For Dart-only fixes that do
not require a new APK, merge the change through a PR without bumping the app
version, then run **Actions → Shorebird Patch** with the exact base version
(for example `1.0.4+5`).
